                <h1>Chapter 1: Ace</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Ace, a 12-year-old boy who has busy parents, that really don’t care about him. His mother a CEO and his father is a head scientist who works for “ToysCorp”. Ace like a normal day reads his mother’s note about being home at 8:00 clock. Ace then goes to make breakfast and usually would go to school after eating breakfast but today was the first day of winter break, so he was going to Ted’s house. Ted’s parents Mr. and Ms. Sake are always happy to see Ace. They also get what he’s going through with not having much time to spend with his parents, even during Christmas break. Even when Ace’s parents got holidays, they also went to someplace without him, which sometimes made him sad or mad even. But eventually, he got used to it. Anyways, Ace goes to Ted’s house has a snowball fight, drinks hot cocoa, plays family board games, and just talks with his friend. The best part is Mr. and Ms. Sake let him stay over for a sleepover. It’s not like Ace’s mom wouldn’t care if he slept over at Ted’s house anyways. Sometimes Ace wishes his parents had normal jobs like other people. You probably are wondering about Ted’s life, well his life is basically perfect. He gets to spend time with his parents, goes on fun rides with his parents, and most importantly Ted’s parents love Ted. It’s not like Ace doesn’t get presents or anything like that, but he just wishes his parents would spend time with him. Not much to ask for. Everybody thinks Ace’s life is perfect just because his parents make a lot of money, and Ace isn’t even that popular, but he manages to get through Virginia middle school with Ted. Ace and Ted love Virginia where the weather is perfect, and the land beautiful. They love Virginia! </p>
                <h1>Chapter 2: Chaos</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Meanwhile at “Santa Headquarters”, Santa’s crystal was stolen. Santa’s crystal has magic which powers his machines and factories to make toys. The crystal also keeps the headquarters hidden. When Santa checked the security cameras it showed one man, and a woman stealing the crystal. Santa traced the two people on a computer and figured out they were from “ToysCorp”. The woman was a CEO and the man was a head scientist. These were people who stole the crystal. Santa looked into the profiles and found out that the two who stole the crystal had a son named Ace. He also found that the parents didn’t really look after Ace. A bigger problem was that they were preparing for Christmas, and since they don’t have the crystal they can’t make any toys. Santa was determined not to let that happen. Santa made a plan that he could communicate with the company, and see if they would give the crystal back. But until then, Santa’s headquarters was on red alert. A red alert would mean that on every door and hall there would be security elves. It would be really hard to get in, and even if you did get in, you wouldn’t be able to get out. Santa went into his room to talk to the company that stole his crystal, but even though Santa tried to be polite as possible, the company refused to give the crystal back. Santa asked why the company stole the crystal, and they said they wanted to be the only powerful company to make toys and sell them for money. Santa couldn’t even talk to the CEO. Santa decided, he would have to go to where Ace is now, and using Ace’s help he would get that crystal back. But he wouldn’t stop there. He would expose what the company has done and take them down, so they wouldn’t be able to harm anyone else again. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 3: Convincing</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Santa goes to Ted’s house because that is where his GPS brought him to. Santa first sneaks into the house, then he puts a small chip in Ted’s parents to put them asleep until Santa, Ace, and possibly Ted get back from their mission. After Santa inserted the chip in Ted’s parents he snuck into Ted’s room and also found Ace there. Then he turned on the lights and Ace and Ted screamed loudly. But Santa quieted them down and told them that he needed their help, and after like 30 minutes they said maybe. Depending on if Santa told them the details. So Santa explained about his crystal being stolen by a company , and how it powers his factories to make toys for children. Santa decided to leave out the part about how Ace’s parents are the ones who stole the crystal. Then Santa told them to get into the sleigh to go to his headquarters in the north pole. Then Ted asked about his parents, and Santa said he put them to sleep and would wake them up when they came back. Santa told Ted his parents are perfectly fine and that seemed to comfort Ted, so Santa guided them to the sled. After a few minutes, they took off to go to the north pole. After they reached Santa’s headquarters, Santa explained to them about breaking into the company and getting his crystal back. For the sake of Christmas, he told them. Then Santa told them if they helped him he would give them presents, and make the relationship between Ace, and Ace’s parents good. Santa also explained some special ops elves would be joining them because the company is heavily guarded by human guards, lots of cameras, and guard dogs. Santa also said that the elves are equipped with stun dart guns and smoke bombs. He said for their own safety everybody will also get their own stun gun, and Ace also got something special, a little laser. Santa said he knew he could trust him if they were ever in danger during the mission. Then Ace asked if they could travel in an elf snowmobile that he saw well they were coming in, and Santa agreed they could do that. “The mission is about to begin”, they all thought. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 4: The Break In Begins</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Ace, Ted, and Santa get out of the elf’s snowmobile after a long journey. After they get out of the snowmobile they go to the fence. That’s when they realized trying to get in without a good plan was going to be very hard. There were more guards than expected, there were so many cameras, and to get in you had to have an ID. So the special ops elf’s decided on cutting some of the fences to squeeze through. They then had to wait until the camera turned the other way, when it finally did they all went inside the fence. The company was huge, it had about 8 different buildings/ factories. Then Santa used his GPS to find the crystal, the crystal was apparently in the main building, which was huge to Ace. The elves started cutting the glass when an alarm sounded and all the guards started scanning the ground for intruders. Ace,Ted, Santa, and the elves all hid in some nearby barrels until the guards passed. Two of the guards are still right next to them so one of the elves shot the two guards with a stun dart. The dart would put them to sleep for a long time. Then they carefully made their way into the building through the glass they cut. They slowly crept through the hallway, and then Santa used his GPS again to find the crystal. The GPS showed it was in a room not far from them. So, they cautiously walked through the hallway, to the room the crystal was being held. Then they suddenly saw three guards at the door of the room, and this time two of the elves shot them with their stun darts again. They all hated shooting them with stun darts, but this time it was necessary. Then when Ace reaches for the door handle, an alarm sounds, and a heavy net falls on them. They all knew it, they were exposed! </p>
                <h1>Chapter 5: Captured!!</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">After the net fell on all of them. Five guards appeared, and they all tried to escape, but the guards grabbed them and blindfolded them. The guards took them to a room where each one of them was strapped down to a chair, and none of them could move. The worst part was the guards took the elf’s gadgets away. But when the guards left, Santa smiled. At first, Ace was confused, but then Ace remembered he had a laser Santa gave him. They didn’t search Ace properly, and Ace still had a little laser that can cut through almost anything, he also had a stun gun which he could use if it came to that. Then a woman comes in. It was his mom! But, before Ace could talk to his mom, she said, “that they knew what they were here for, and that they were never going to get the crystal”. Ace’s mom was different, she seemed different, and kind of evil. Then Ace’s mom asked,“ Santa to explain everything to her son”. Santa explained, “that he didn’t tell him that Ace’s mom was the one who stole the crystal because he thought Ace might not help and might sabotage the mission”. Then Santa asked,“ Ace’s mom to let them out, but she said no”. She said, “she and dad were going to brainwash them, so they could never try to get the crystal again”. Then she left and promised she would come back soon to finish them off, but she said if Ace told her where Santa’s headquarters is located, he would be spared. Ace knew he had to choose a side, his parents’ side which could spare him, and not ruin his life or his friends’ side, and help them escape, and get the crystal. Ace’s decision was easy. He was going to help his friends. I mean his parents never cared about him, might brainwash him and his friends, and who knew the horrible things she did in the past he thought. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 6: Escape</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Ace carefully, but quickly layered all the straps of everybody, so they could escape. Then they all slowly went out of the door, and thankfully there were no guards at the door. They must have thought they wouldn’t be able to escape. Well, we did they all seemed to be saying. Anyways after they escaped the room they crept to the room where the crystal was being held. This time the special ops elves picked the lock and disabled the camera inside the room. Then they took the crystal out really fast and put a heavy book in its place. They all figured out the crystal had a weigh sensor, so when there wasn’t any weight on the pad an alarm would sound. Then they took pictures of the rooms, hallways, guards, the room where they were strapped down, and the cameras to use as evidence later in court that were captured by this company. Then they went to a file room and took the files that might help them in court to take down this company. Then they snuck out of the building, and that’s when an alarm rang, that they escaped. They knew they had to get out past the fence quickly to not get captured, but then guards spot them, and this time they all knew what they had to do. They took the stun guns and fired. Most of the guards were asleep now. Then they reached the fence and crawled through the hole they cut. They escaped! Then from there, they walked to the snowmobiles, dropped of Ted, and Santa and Ace went to Santa’s headquarters, because Ace didn’t have a family anymore, and that Santa wanted to file a court case. Santa also used magic to restore Ted’s parents and to make them forget I was ever at their house. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 7: The Truth</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Santa and Ace are back at Santa’s Headquarters. They start looking through the files for evidence against “Toyscorp” the company where they were captured and held prisoner for a short period of time. Ace finds this one file that surprises him so much, that he drops the file. After Ace picks up the file, he shows it to Santa, who also has a surprising reaction. The file says real parents of Ace, it shows a woman and man, holding Ace. But now it all makes sense Ace thought. Ace’s fake parents (which is what he is calling his parents who work for “Toyscorp”) never cared about him and treated him like he didn’t really matter. But, another interesting thing the file says is, his real parents started “Toyscorp”, but they quit because they thought “Toyscorp” was getting evil, and out of control. But the file says, before his real parents escaped, they took a file, which had evidence of the bad things “Toyscorp” did. The file also said his real parents tried to control “Toyscorp”, by filling a case on them, but “Toyscorp” found the real parents, and Ace, the parents managed to get away with the file, but “Toyscorp” took Ace. The file also stated that the company took Ace because when Ace is big if his parents aren’t there and go missing, he gets the rights to the company, so they burned all the files, that Ace was related to his parents. The last thing the file said was after his real parents left, a woman became the CEO and head of the company, and a man became the head scientist. Ace and Santa came to the same conclusion after Ace’s real parents left, his fake parents came to power. Ace and Santa also decided they needed to find Ace’s real parents. With the real parents, they could shut down this company once, and for all. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 8: Hidden</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">After Ace, and Santa figure out Ace’s real parents are somewhere out there, Santa searches his databases to where Ace’s parents were last seen. The database show Ace’s parents were last seen in Kentucky and live in a small village called “Ho”. Ace and Santa though they probably lived in a small village because they didn’t want to attract much attention. Ace and Santa what they had to do. Go on a trip to Kentucky’s small village called “Ho”. Santa’s sled takes them to the outskirts of Kentucky in an hour. Santa said they ad to land on the outskirts of Kentucky to not be seen on a flying sled. From the outskirts, they took a car which took them to the village in about 3 to 4 hours. After they made it to the village they asked a nearby villager where Sam and Ruth were, that’s what Santa’s database said, but Santa didn’t tell Ace until they got to the village. Anyway, the villager pointed them toward a small hut. After they reached the small hut, they knocked on the door. A woman opened it, she is probably Sam, Ace thought. She asked who we were, and we asked if we could come in. She looked suspicious but said yes. After they sat on the couch a man came into the hall, he was probably Ruth, Ace thought. After Sam and Ruth sat on the couch, they explained everything, about “Toyscorp”, Ace being their real son, and how they needed their help to shut down “Toyscorp” with their file that they have. Ace and Santa waited for some time, for the information to sink in. Then Sam and Ruth said that they trust Santa and Ace. They said they would help with whatever plan they had. They also said it was time they stepped up to “Toyscorp”. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 9: Rejection</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">After Santa, and Ace meet Ace’s parents, Santa and Ace go to the Virginia courthouse. They try to meet a judge. But first, they have to go through security, and a security official stops them and makes them wait an hour. Then the official tells them to leave, and when Santa wants to know why, the official won’t respond. Ace and Santa are determined to meet that judge, so they come up with a plan to sneak in because they know no matter how much they try to get in, the official won’t let them in. Santa and Ace noticed a pattern in the guards when they switched. Ace and Santa go into the building when a guard left, they ran inside before somebody could see them, and as soon as they got inside another guard came in for his shift. After they got inside they try to run for the judge, but the judge immediately ordered security guards to take Santa and Ace away. The guards hear the call and grab Ace and Santa, and throw them outside. Then the security guard calls the police, and the police take them to a police van and throw them inside the van. Then the police van takes them to the police station. Then the head police question them and want to know what they were doing at the Virginia courthouse. Santa and Ace tell the head police that they were just trying to go to the judge, and the judge called security immediately. The head police says,“ he is actually friends with the judge, and he will investigate the judge’s actions”. Then he let Santa and Ace go.</p>
                <h1>Chapter 10: Bribery</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">On the morning of December 10, fourteen days until the court hearing, Ace and Santa receive a call from the Virginia police department. Santa picks up the phone, and the head police department tells them they have some information, about the judge, and they should meet them at the Virginia courthouse. After they go to the Virginia courthouse, they meet the head police, and they all go to the judge’s room. There the head police says the judge that he has probably been bribed. His files show a lot of accepting bribes cases on the judge. The judge then starts to sweat, and the head police tells him to fess up if he’s been bribed. The judge then suddenly cries, and he admits that he has been bribed. Then the judge starts explaining: ” Three days ago on Saturday, the CEO of a company called “Toyscrop,” said she would give me money if I didn’t meet with Ace and Santa, she also threatened to brainwash my family including my 4-year-old daughter. She also said if I called the police she would brainwash my family. I had to accept her deal or I would have no family to come back to, on Christmas.” “The CEO is my fake mother. How could she do something this evil?” Ace thought. Santa also seemed to come to the same conclusion about Ace’s fake mother. She has pure evil in her. But the judge felt bad for not taking their case, so he agreed he would take their case. But under one condition, the police and special ops elves have to protect my family at all costs. Santa and the head police agreed without even thinking. “How could we not protect his family after hearing this?” they both thought. It was all set, everything was going according to plan. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 11: Redemption</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">On the morning of December 23, Santa, and Ace went to the Virginia Courthouse. After Santa and Ace go to the courthouse they meet up with their lawyer, who they made sure he didn’t get bribed. Then the lawyer, Santa, and Ace gathered all their evidence against “Toyscorp”, and made their way to the courtroom. They sat until the judge, and the “Toyscorp” representative came in. Which was Ace’s mom. The judge came in at the last minute and ordered everyone to have a seat, and they began the court case. Santa, and Ace’s lawyer argued that “Toyscorp” did multiple criminal activities, and the whole company should be shut down. With the head of the company being arrested, and put in jail. The lawyer also should the file to prove that “Toyscorp” did this. “Toyscorp” lawyer argued that Santa and Ace broke into their compound, and buildings, and also said that “Toyscorp” was a well, and well organized company. “Toyscorp’s” lawyer showed their footage and evidence of Santa, and Ace breaking into the company through the fence. Santa was smiling. It was all a tie. Then before the judge could make a decision. Ace’s real parents stepped through the door. Ace had been wondering where his real parents were. Now Ace seemed to understand why Santa was laughing. He could also see his fake mom, “Toyscorp” CEO in total shock, and surprise. Ace’s real parents said that they were a witness and that they were the real owners of “Toyscorp” but soon “Toyscorp” got out of hand and begin doing criminal activities, and they said that’s why they quit. They also said they try to put up a court case against “Toyscorp”, but before that “Toyscorp” found them, and “Toyscorp” took their son Ace, when he was a baby. Then Ace and Santa spoke up and said they only broke into “Toyscorp”, because “Toyscorp” stole Santa’s crystal, and they just stole it back. They also explained how Ace’s fake mom, the CEO of “Toyscorp” threatened to brainwash them if Ace didn’t tell the location of Santa’s hideout. After hearing everything, the judge decided, “Toyscorp” should be shut down, and The CEO of the company should be arrested and should spend life imprisonment. The judge also said that Ace and Santa did the right thing, and it was very brave of them to step up to a big company. After hearing this Ace, Santa, Santa’s lawyer, and Ace’s real parents cheered and hooted. They won the court case! </p>
                <h1>Chapter 12: The End</h1>
                <p style="font-size: 18px;">Excited about their win they all celebrated. Ace even invited Ted over, and his parents, Since Ace and Santa talked to Ted’s parents about what happened. They said they felt really sorry for Ace, and know that it hurt a lot for Ace. But now was a time for celebration. They all decided to celebrate at Ace’s, and Ace,s parents’ new home. It was huge. with their own big swimming pool, big patio, and big kitchen, basically everything was big in the house. Ace and Ted played board games, played tag, and ate a lot of food. After the party was over Santa said if he ever needed help, he would call Ace. Santa even gave Ace his phone number. As for Ace’s parents, they said,“ if they never had a problem again they could really on Ace and Santa”. Then Santa left in his sleigh. Ace’s real parents and Ace were getting along really well. They went to restaurants, and they also do a lot of other places. It was fun. Ace loved his new room, new house, and new video games that he got as an early Christmas present, and to make for missing his birthday. Ace was happy, and the best part his their new house was only five minutes from Ted’s house, which was the best, because they got to go to each other’s houses whenever they wanted, and they had a lot of fun. </p>
                <h1>Chapter 13: Epilogue</h1>
